## Google spreadsheet as a data source

Read data in a Google Spreadsheet. 
    *You need the spreadsheet <i>key</i>, which is the long sequence of characters visible in the address bar when editing the spreadsheet in a browser.  
    *And the spreadsheet must be shared so that "Anyone with the link can view" the document.

Uses Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage">Query Language</a> to retrieve the data.

Python (3.4):
```
python try.py
```

Nodejs:
```
node try
```
